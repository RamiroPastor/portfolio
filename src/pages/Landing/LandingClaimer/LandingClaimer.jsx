          Ramiro Pastor Mart√≠n (the "Author") claims that everything in this personal portfolio (the "Site") 
          is a result of his own creativity, design, work, and testing (except all the logos and fonts).

        <ul className="LandingClaimer__list">
          <li>All the background mosaics</li>

          Finally, the Author does not claim that the Site follows the mainstream criteria neither for 
          color balancing and sobriety, nor for lack of variety in font usage.
